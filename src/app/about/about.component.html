        Cisco Meraki's Scanning API delivers data in real-time from the Meraki cloud via HTTP POST of JSON data to campus server and saved in Database.
        It could be used to detect WiFi(associated and non-associated) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices in real-time or past(within month).
        The JSON posts occur frequently, typically batched every minute for each AP.
        Using the physical placement of the access points from the Map & Floorplan on the Dashboard, the Meraki cloud estimates the location of the client. 
        The geo-location coordinates (latitude, longitude) and X,Y location data accuracy can vary based on a number of factors. 
        AP placement, environmental conditions, and client device orientation can influence X,Y estimation;
